主访: HAOMI
YONGHU: Got it.
HAOMI: And can you briefly introduce yourself, like your age, occupation, or family, like that?
YONGHU: My name is YONGHU. I live in Southern California. I am 55. I care for my disabled brother at home. So my job is going to Disneyland and the circus and hiking. I have a really good job.
HAOMI: How many cars do you have?
YONGHU: I have one car.
HAOMI: Is that … Oh, it's a jeep, right?
YONGHU: It's jeep.
HAOMI: Oh, okay, when did you buy it?
YONGHU: I bought her August 17, the 2021.
HAOMI: 2021. Can I know why did you buy the jeep rather than a sedan or Suv or other type of vehicle?
YONGHU: A jeep has been my dream car since I was a little girl. And I knew in my head, the color, what I wanted inside of her. And one morning I woke up and I was looking, and I found the perfect one. So we went and got her.
HAOMI: Do you do any modification for the jeep?
YONGHU: Oh, yeah.
HAOMI: Like, what.
YONGHU: I lifted her I put bigger tires on her. She's got a roof rack. She's got skid plates. She's got…Oh, my God, I can't think of them, something on the side. So when I hit a rock I just roll right off of it. I can't think of what it's called right now.
HAOMI: So why did you do the modification?
YONGHU: Because I take her off-roading. We go rock climbing and go up to the mountains. We actually just got back from Utah, and that's where… it was funny. I got an invitation to an interview about refrigerators, which I thought was hilarious because I bought one, and it keeps making it. If I leave it plugged in. I come out in the morning, and my car is dead, so I found another one. Then they're both in the garage. You'll see them both.
YONGHU: It's much bigger. It takes up the entire back of my car. I don't know if I love that, but it's a better brand. So it knows when the car is off, so it will reduce how much power it takes. I don't know which one I love better. Yet I like the smaller one, because I have room to put everything else.
HAOMI: So do you use them at the same time, or you always use one at one time?
YONGHU: Well, we just got back from a 3 week trip in Utah, where we went off roading, and I use 3 refrigerators to store food in the jeep when we're driving. I use one to keep our lunches and waters cold.
HAOMI: So when you use the 3 refrigerators? What type of vehicle do you use?
YONGHU: Oh, well, we stayed in Utah for 2 weeks, so all of the refrigerators I can lower them to set it up as a freezer, so I use them to store all of our food.

3:46
HAOMI: And usually what outdoor activities or types of travel do you usually do?
YONGHU: Camping, off-roading, when I go to Disneyland I'll bring the refrigerator and put waters and drinks in there and then, everything's cold. I don't have to bring the lunchbox that keeps food cold. I put everything in the refrigerator.
HAOMI: Is there a difference between the off-roading you mentioned and the typical road trip?
YONGHU: A trip like we just got back from Disneyland for 3 days. It just keeps food for the day cold, like waters, my red bull, sandwiches. When we're going off roading. I always pack like something bad's gonna happen like we're gonna break down. And I'm gonna need food for like a day or 2. So I put more food in there. For the camping trip. I lowered the temperature, to like 4 degrees, and I froze all the food so, as we needed it, we took it out and cooked it.
HAOMI: So if only focus on the activity, the definition of the activity. What's the difference between off-roading and the road trip?
YONGHU: Off roading is when you go up in the mountains and you go where normal cars can't go, sightseeing. It's longer, it's like 8h behind the wheel. A road trip, me going to Disneyland. It takes me an hour to get there.
HAOMI: So are they 2 different activities, or one is part of another?
YONGHU: There are 2 different activities.

5:38
HAOMI: Okay, right, thank you. So about off roading, can I know how regular do you go on them.
YONGHU: Usually 2 or 3 times a month.
HAOMI: And each time, how long does it last?
YONGHU: Normally, it's a day trip. Normally, we meet at like 6 am, and if everything goes well, we're done by 8 pm. And it's constant driving in the car all day. You're going in the mountains, you're going over rocks and big boulders. A few times a year, it's the whole weekend, and once a year, it's 2 weeks.
HAOMI: And how long have you been using the car refrigerator? When did you 1st start to use it?
YONGHU: The smaller one I have. I got about a year and a half ago, and I love it. But it doesn't hold… like if I have more than me and my little brother, it doesn't hold a lot. So for the camping trip, I realized it wasn't gonna hold everything, and it keeps making my car die. So I found on Facebook marketplace, an ARB refrigerator. But it's really really big. It takes up the whole back of my car, so I can't put anything else back there.
HAOMI: Okay, I know the smaller one. What's the capacity of it?
YONGHU: I do not know. I can show it to you.
HAOMI: Okay? And how about the bigger one? Do you know that?
YONGHU: The bigger one is huge.
HAOMI: Can your describe what difference between capacity of these 2, like how many…
YONGHU: The little one will hold maybe a case of soda, the big one can hold 3 cases of soda is really big.
HAOMI: So when you mentioned a case of soda, does it mean 12?
YONGHU: 24.
HAOMI: 24. Okay, thank you. And so besides, the outdoor activities like the camping and off roading you mentioned, do you take the car refrigerator? when you like… do some grocery shopping or…?
YONGHU: When I 1st got it, we buy frozen ice cream, and in the summer here it's so hot that by the time I get home it's all melted. So when I 1st got it, it would hold a case of frozen popsicles. The big one will hold 3 case, probably 4 cases of frozen popsicles, but I couldn't close it, but it kept it cold enough so I could get home with it.
HAOMI: So can I say mainly you bring the refrigerator for the outdoor activity, like the off-roading?
YONGHU: I do it for that sometimes. I've used it twice at home, where I take it out of the car like right now it's out of the car because I just have my car washed, and I plug it in if we're having a pool party and people want cold drinks, it works out great that way.
HAOMI: So you also use it when you at home, when there is a party? 
YONGHU: Yeah.
HAOMI: So you mentioned the off roading only last one day, usually right? So usually it's a short distance when you take the car refrigerator outing.
YONGHU: It's different. It could be right in the mountains right here, or we could drive possibly 2h to go get to it. It just depends on where we're going.
HAOMI: And you did you do the long distance trip like for 2 weeks, for one month? Do you do that? How often do you do that?
YONGHU: I'm in California. We just got back 10 days ago from Utah, where we went for 2 weeks.
HAOMI: Okay. Alright, thank you.

10:16
HAOMI: So can recall this latest trip like you just described the between Utah and California. Was there any moments on that trip that the car refrigerator didn't quite meet your needs, or let you felt really hard to use.
YONGHU: No, I had no problems with any of them. They worked perfectly.
HAOMI: About the positive, were there any special moment that you felt is really happy to use it when you on the road trip.
YONGHU: Well, we just went to Utah, and it was really really hot. And you're in the car all day driving through the sand, going over rocks. So with it being so hot outside. When you stop for a break, a cold drink is refreshing, so to have cold water available when you need it. I love my refrigerator. I wouldn't be without one.
HAOMI: Oh, it's hot! Can I know the temperature, the degree?
YONGHU: When I'm going out I usually keep it at like 34°F, and my refrigerator cools down like that. And it has an app on my phone where I can control it.
HAOMI: Both of them?
YONGHU: I don't know about the other one yet, because I'm still cleaning it out. But the smaller one has an app.

12:00
HAOMI: Okay, can you give more detail like when you go out for the off-roading or road trip who usually with you?
YONGHU: Road trip is normally my brother and I. We will go to Disneyland or Seaworld, and I use the refrigerator just for his drinks, maybe his medicine and our sandwiches. If I'm going off roading, it's usually 20 or 30 people with jeeps that meet, and then we go up to the mountains and drive our jeeps around.
HAOMI: That's interesting. I saw you have the pets right? Do you have dog or cat?
YONGHU: I have a dog.
HAOMI: Oh, so does it come along with you for those trips?
YONGHU: Always.
HAOMI: Always? So both the off roading and the road trip?
YONGHU: No Disneyland for him, but he goes everywhere else with us.
HAOMI: Are there any certain items you bring along just for the dog?
YONGHU: Water.
HAOMI: Oh, only water, no other food?
YONGHU: His food doesn't have to be cold. It's dry food.
HAOMI: Okay? Right?
HAOMI: So his food is packed with yours. Right? Because they are just water?
YONGHU: Right. His food doesn't have to be cold. So I usually don't put it in the refrigerator.
HAOMI: Can I know when you go with your brother. Is there any specific items you just bring for yourself or for him? Specially for you or for him.
YONGHU: Red Bull for me. Because Disneyland is a 15h day, so I need my red bulls, waters, sandwiches. Sometimes I'll pack his insulin. It has to stay cold, so I put it in the refrigerator. That's it.
HAOMI: And about the insulin, the medicine, how do you pack them in the car refrigerator?
YONGHU: How do I pack the medicine?
HAOMI: Yeah. How do you pack and organize it in the car refrigerator?
YONGHU: My refrigerator has a… you open it, and it has one big, deep compartment, and then it has one up here, so I usually put my red bulls up here, and I put his pens for his insulin right on top, and then when I need it, I just grab it.
HAOMI: Okay.
YONGHU: And then when I pack our food like, if I pack him fruit, I put it in Tupperware and I put it on the bottom, and then I put a sandwiches on the top. When I bring the refrigerator and I pack us lunch I put everything in the refrigerator, potato, chips, everything goes in there.
